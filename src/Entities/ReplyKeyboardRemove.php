 * Class ReplyKeyboardRemove
 *
 * Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will remove the current custom keyboard and display the default letter-keyboard. By default, custom keyboards are displayed until a new keyboard is sent by a bot. An exception is made for one-time keyboards that are hidden immediately after the user presses a button (see [ReplyKeyboardMarkup](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api/#replykeyboardmarkup)).
